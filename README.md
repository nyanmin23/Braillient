# Braillient 💡
Helping the blind read – a Burmese Braille text converter for inclusive education.

---

## 🏆 Project Overview
**Braillient** is a web application developed to assist visually impaired students in Myanmar by converting Burmese text into Burmese Braille. It was created as part of the **Hub&Hack 2022** ideation competition, where our team, **The Quirky Geeks**, won first place in the Senior Level category.

This tool aims to close the accessibility gap in the education sector by offering a simple and effective way to generate Braille learning materials — something that mainstream smart education apps often overlook.

## ✨ Features
- 🔠 Converts **typed Myanmar (Burmese) text** into Burmese Braille.
- 🧑‍💻 Clean, minimal interface designed with accessibility in mind.
- ⚙️ Functional buttons: `Convert`, `Clear`, and `Copy`.
- 🖨️ Output can be copied for further use, including printing.

## 📌 Motivation
In Myanmar, students with visual impairments face significant challenges due to the lack of accessible educational tools. Our team wanted to create a localized solution that can translate content into Braille to support their learning journey — empowering them with the resources they deserve.
